# SpecVis

Uses the Piccolo Toolkit.


Interface Description

The fisheye browser uses a grid layout to preserve the timeseries concept behind the study of SNe. Each dot of the grid corresponds to a supernova spectrum. The vertical axis contains the target names of the supernovae and on the horizontal has the age in days of the supernova or the phase. The period of scientific interest in the study of type Ia SNe ranges between 15 days before peak brightness and 40 days after peak brightness. 

In order to see a more detailed spectrum, the user clicks on one of the spectrum nodes and the fisheye technique makes the clicked dot and its neighbors bigger. The user can click one more time on the spectrum of interest and the zooming is taken at a higher level.
